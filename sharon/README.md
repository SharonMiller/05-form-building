# Form Building

**Author**: Sharon Miller
**Version**: 1.5.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We are building a blog that can add articles that can be filtered by author and category.  It also has a navbar which uses SPA design. It also has a form where we can add new blog posts with markup and highlighting.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user needs to scaffold out the HTML with a nav and templates for articles and filters using Handlebars. Then the user needs to setup some basic CSS for the nav, footer and template article.  Then the user needs to setup and article Constructor Object from database.  Then the user needs to add filters for author name and category and populate them.  Then the user needs to hide and show articles according to filter.  Then the user needs to create nav functionality that shows/hides parts of the page. Finally the user needs to add the Mark.js and highlight.js libraries to enable a user to add a new blog post with the option to include code. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used JS, Jquery & Handlebars libraries, CSS/HTML, mark.js and highlight.js

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
First we added script tags and a link to our new libraries
Next we added the HTML scaffolding for the form. 
Then we added the javascript.
